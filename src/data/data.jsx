As an avid fan of the game myself, this is a project I hope that I can expand upon and one day even deploy for other fans. I contributed to primarily the backend design of this project, being left in charge of ensuring the database relationships were set up properly as well as ensuring that the paths to user accounts, user characters, comments, etc. were reaching the appropriate destination.",

Looking up a city will give the user the forecasted weather for the current day as well as the predicted weather for the following 5 days. All this includes the current temperature, the wind speeds, humidity, and the UV-Index reading for that day. Given what I've learned since I built this, I plan to remake this application some time to see what I can do differently and improve upon.",
